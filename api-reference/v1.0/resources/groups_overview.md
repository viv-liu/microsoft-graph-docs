# Working with groups in Microsoft Graph

Groups are collections of [users](user.md) and other principals who share access to resources in Microsoft services or in your app. Microsoft Graph provides you with APIs to create and manage a variety of different types of groups and group functionality to suit your scenario needs. All operations in Microsoft Graph on groups require administrator consent.

> **Note**: Groups can only be created through work or school accounts, and are not supported for personal Microsoft accounts.

| Type              | Use case | groupType | mail-enabled | security-enabled | Creation possible through API? |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|--------------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| Office 365 groups | Facilitating user collaboration with shared Microsoft online resources. | ["Unified"] | true | false | yes | [user](user.md) | 
| Security groups | Controlling user access to in-app resources. | [] | false | true | yes |
| Mail-enabled security groups | Controlling user access to in-app resources, with a shared group mailbox. | [] | true | true | no |
| Distribution groups | Distributing mail to the members of the group. It is recommended to use Office 365 groups due to the richer set of resources it provides. | [] | true | false | yes |

## Office 365 groups in Outlook
The power of Office 365 groups is in its collaborative nature, perfect for people who work together on a project or a team. They are created with resources that members of the group share including:

- Outlook conversations
- Outlook calendar
- SharePoint files
- OneNote notebook
- SharePoint team site
- Planner
- Intune device management

Other resources that are created but not accessible through the API include: 

- Dynamics CRM
- Microsoft Social Engagement
- Microsoft Stream
- Microsoft StaffHub

    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#groups/$entity",

        "Unified"
    ],
    "mail": "outlookgroup101@service.microsoft.com",

## Security groups and mail-enabled security groups
Security groups are for controlling user access to resources. By checking whether or not a user is a member of a security group, your app can make authorization decisions when that user is trying to access some secure resources in your app. Security groups can have users and other security groups as members.

Mail-enabled security groups are used in the same way as security groups are, but with the added feature of a shared mailbox for the groups. Mail-enabled security groups can't be created through the API, but other group operations will still work here. Learn more in the [Manage mail-enabled security groups Exchange article](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb123521(v=exchg.160).aspx).

### Example of security group

```http
{
    "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.group",
    "id": "f87faa71-57a8-4c14-91f0-517f54645106",
    "deletedDateTime": null,
    "classification": null,
    "createdDateTime": "2016-07-20T09:21:23Z",
    "description": "This group is a Security Group",
    "displayName": "SecurityGroup101",
    "groupTypes": [],
    "mail": null,
    "mailEnabled": false,
    "mailNickname": "mysg",
    "preferredLanguage": null,
    "proxyAddresses": [],
    "securityEnabled": true
}
```
## Dynamic membership 
All types of groups can have dynamic membership rules which automatically add or remove members from the group based on user properties. For example, a "Marketing employees" group would include every user with the department property set to "Marketing", so that new marketing employees are automatically added to the group and employees who leave the department are automatically removed from the group. This rule can be specified in a "membershipRule" field during group creation as ```"membershipRule": 'user.department -eq "Marketing"'``` GroupType must also include ```"DynamicMembership"```. The following request creates a new Office 365 group for the marketing employees: 

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups
{
    "description": "Marketing department folks",
    "displayName": "Marketing department",
    "groupTypes": [
        "Unified",
        "DynamicMembership"
    ],
    "mailEnabled": true,
    "mailNickname": "marketing",
    "securityEnabled": false,
    "membershipRule": 'user.department -eq "Marketing"',
    "membershipRuleProcessingState": "on"
}
```

Learn more about formulating membershipRules in [advanced rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-groups-dynamic-membership-azure-portal).

> **Note**: Dynamic membership rules requires the tenant to have a license at tier [Azure Active Directory Premium P1](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/active-directory/) or greater.

## Other types of groups

Office 365 groups in Yammer are used to facilitate user collaboration through Yammer posts. This type of group can be returned through a read request, but their posts can't be accessed through the API. To learn more, see [Yammer developer API docs](https://developer.yammer.com/docs).
